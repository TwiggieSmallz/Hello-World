# Hello-World
First repo here on Github.

Hello fellow coding peoples! I'm new to development but am very interested in learning more and eventually create my own apps and softwares. I've been a lurker on this site for a few years now and I humbly thank any and all persons whose projects have been made available at no cost for community usage. I've completed courses in HTML, CSS, and Go-Lang so far and am currently studying Python, PHP, MySQL, Java, Javascript, jQuery, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. 

I'm still finding my ideal path in development and thus have a very wide scope of potential languages to learn. I haven't dove deep enough yet to find my "passion" in development, whether that be coding the engine to run the software or doing UX design. So, while I experiment and find my path, I hope to give back a little to the community that has given so much, and hopefully find some new collegues in this field willing to give pointers and advice to noobs like me.

Cheers!
